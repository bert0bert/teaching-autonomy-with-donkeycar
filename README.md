# Teaching Autonomy Through Donkeycar

This experiment utilizes Donkeycar, the "Hello World" of self-driving cars. This experiment will teach you the basics of self-driving cars and how to use them with small RC cars

It should take 2-3 hours to run through this experiment.

You can run this experiment on the [Cloudlab](https://cloudlab.us/) testbed. To run this experiment you should already have an account on cloudlab, be part of a project, and have access to a small-lan profile.

## Background

### Donkeycar

Donkeycar is an open-source self-driving platform that allows people from various backgrounds utilize self-driving in their Remote Controlled (RC) cars without having to deal with low-level details. The reason we use Donkeycar is because of it's high-level of abstraction and how easy it us to use in an experiment. It's a great way to close the gap between the hardware of your car and machine learning implemented in python, that way the experimenter doesn't need to worry about writing code.
